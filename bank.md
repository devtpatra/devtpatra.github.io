# HR Data Analysis

## Research Questions
- Which job title is leaving the most?

- What are the determinants of employee job satisfaction?
- What are the key factors influencing employee attrition?


I conducted an analysis to determine what factors influencing employee job satisfaction at IBM. Job Satisfaction is measured using a score of 1 to 5. The purpose of this analysis is to see if IBM can do anything to keep satisfaction rates high. I used a linear regression model to see each variableâ€™s impact.
